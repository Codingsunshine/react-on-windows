# How to: Setup a React development environment on Windows

Guide to installing the tools required to run React+Webpack (via create-react-app) on Windows

> **Attention! Before getting started!** This guide was tested on Windows 10 using Node v6.11.1 and npm 5.3.0. Optionally, we highly recommend installing Git Bash for Windows. When you install both Node.js and Git bash, make sure that the _default_ options to add both to your *PATH* are checked off.

## Steps

1. Installing Node.js v6.11.1
2. Running the Node.js Command Prompt
3. Upgrading **npm**
4. Installing **create-react-app**
5. Creating a basic React application
6. Starting your React application
7. Editing your React application
8. Releasing your React application to the public

#### 1. Installing Node.js

> Please install Node v6.11.10. [Here is a direct link to the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It is labelled under **LTS** and _not_ **Current Release**.
