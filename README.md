# How to: Setup a React development environment on Windows

Guide to installing the tools required to run React+Webpack (via create-react-app) on Windows

> This guide was tested on Windows 10 using Node v6.11.1 and npm 5.3.0 - [Download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Optionally, we highly recommend installing [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). When you install both Node.js and Git bash, make sure that the _default_ options to add both to your *PATH* are checked off.
