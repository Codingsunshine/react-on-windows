# How to: Setup a React development environment on Windows

Guide to installing the tools required to run React+Webpack (via create-react-app) on Windows

> **Attention! Before getting started!** This guide was tested on Windows 10 using Node v6.11.1 and npm 5.3.0 - [Download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Optionally, we highly recommend installing [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). When you install both Node.js and Git bash, make sure that the _default_ options to add both to your *PATH* are checked off.

## Steps

1. Installing Node.js v6.11.1
2. Running the Node.js Command Prompt
3. Upgrading **npm**
4. Installing **create-react-app**
5. Creating a basic React application
6. Starting your React application
7. Editing your React application
8. Releasing your React application to the public
